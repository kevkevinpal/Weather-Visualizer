# Weather-Visualizer

To set up enviorment type
`pip install apscheduler`
`pip install pyowm`
install Node.js and NPM
`npm install d3.js`
## What does it do?

While this project is still currently in progress its goal is to use python grab data from OpenWeatherMaps's API
(you can find [OpenWeatherMaps site](https://openweathermap.org/)) and input this data into a TSV file which we will use as our database.
What I am currently slowly implementing is a visualal representation of the data that the python code took and to represent
it by using the D3.js JavaScript library.

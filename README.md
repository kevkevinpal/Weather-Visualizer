##What does it do?

While this project is still currently in progress its goal is to use python grab data from OpenWeatherMaps's API 
(you can find [OpenWeatherMaps site here](https://openweathermap.org/)) and input this data into a MySql database.
What I am currently slowly implementing is a visualal representation of the data that the python code took and to represent
it by using the D3.js JavaScript library.
